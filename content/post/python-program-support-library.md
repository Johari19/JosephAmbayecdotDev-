**This is my most ambitious project in python yet! It's the Python Program Support Library. It will be a library that all python developers can use, from beginners to experts!**

This library will enable the use of a multitude of functions that can be used in most programs!

Check out my github and youtube video on this:

one day I hope to get my library on pip! Maybe I'll look like this:$ pip3 install ppsl$ python3>>> from ppsl import *
```
